# Username for the database connection (often 'root' in local development).

# ?? JPA/HIBERNATE CONFIGURATION
# Hibernate DDL (Data Definition Language) setting.
# 'update': Hibernate will attempt to create tables if they don't exist and update the schema based on changes to your JPA entities.
# It is generally safe for development but requires caution in production.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
# Setting this to 'true' will log all the SQL statements generated by Hibernate to the console,
# which is useful for debugging and performance tuning.
spring.jpa.show.sql=true
